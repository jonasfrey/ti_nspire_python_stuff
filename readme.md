# python

## (almost) no libraries 
remember on the ti-nspire python runs, but without modules/libs 
working so far: 
- math
- sys

## no f"string {n_inter}-polation"
string interpolation with f"test{n_num}" does not work, might be because of the python version
i don't know the exact python version
